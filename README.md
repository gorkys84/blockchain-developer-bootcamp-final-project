Tracking medicines through supply chain.


Idea: Designing a smart contract and frontend to manage pharmaceutical supplies and track them.

Problem:
In the pharmaceutical industry, it is essential to have reliable records to track and trace each medicine back to the source. It is incredibly difficult for customers or buyers to know that the medicines are genuine and not counterfiet as there is a significant lack of transparency in our current system.


Workflow:

1. Pharma manufactures and suppliers should be able to create tokens for all of there medicines.

2. They need to generate a unique serial number (token) for different type of packaging levels (each, cases, pallet).

3. They can then track the medicines during the different phases of transportation.

4. They can't create duplicate Serial Numbers.

5. Customers should be able to verify the medicines details after buying it from the pharmacy.

As I am new to BlockChain Technology, I will keep updating this document as I make progress with Consensys Bootcamp. We can then use this idea for tracking food items, grocery etc, for now only focusing on pharma industry.

Tech Stack: (As per my current knowledge)

This supply chain management system uses multiple technologies:

Ethereum Blockchain- Ethereum Blockchain Stack (Geth)
VS-Code - Text Editor for writing code
react.js- great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
node.js - evented I/O for the backend
Express - fast node.js network app framework @tjholowaychuk
web3.js - Ethereum Javascript API
Truffle, Ganache - Frameworks
